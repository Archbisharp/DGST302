        Since I don't feel particularly comfortable putting even more data about myself out there for everyone to see, I chose to do this project from the perspective of one of the characters I made for my creative outlets. This focuses on Kyre Proudglade: a dnd character I've been using for over 6 years. Because she is a dnd character I have used frequently, have access to recorded sessions, and literal years worth of notes on what actions she took within game and backstory, I believe there is enough data to display here in an entertaining and informative fashion.

        First; and introduction including her name and art I have done for her. Also included is a short biography in paragraph format. Ideally, I would like to structure this so that her name is above her image and the text is to the right of the image.

        Section two contains the first data profile. It is the number of times she has pinched the bridge of her nose - a sign of annoyance or exhaustion - categorized by who she is pinching the bridge of her nose because. I intend to find a fun way to portray it, but I don't have the coding knowledge to do my idea. I want to do a circle with bars coming out from it like a sun. Five different colors (one for each of the party members and an additional one for notable NPCs) with two bars per color. One bar is for annoyance, the other is for exhaustion.
