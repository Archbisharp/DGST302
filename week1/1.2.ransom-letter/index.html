        <p>Listen up, I don't know who you think you are, but you got something that's mine, and I want it back. Yeah, that thing. The one I can't remember where I left it, but I know you took it.
You think you're sneaky, huh? Well, I got news for you, buddy. I got eyes everywhere. And they're all on you. So, unless you wanna deal with the consequences, you better hand it over.</p>
